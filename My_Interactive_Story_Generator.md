# My Interactive Story Generator

## Mini-Project Definition: Interactive Story Generator

### 1. Project Title
Interactive Story Generator

### 2. Project Purpose
The purpose of this Interactive Story Generator is to engage users creatively by allowing them to collaboratively build unique narratives. It achieves this by presenting stories with grammatical blanks which the user fills in, specifically guiding them on verb tenses to ensure the story's chronological flow. Ultimately, it aims to demonstrate how AI can facilitate a dynamic and educational storytelling experience.

### 3. Essential Core Features

**Interactive Gapped Sentences:** The story unfolds sentence by sentence or paragraph by paragraph, with specific words left as blanks for user input.

**AI-Guided Tense Prompts:** For verb-related blanks, the system explicitly asks the user for a word in a particular tense (e.g., "Enter a past tense verb," "Give me a future action").

**Narrative Flow Integration:** The system seamlessly incorporates the user's inputs, respecting the specified tenses, to build a coherent and evolving story.

### 4. Target User
The primary target user for the Interactive Story Generator is fluent English-speaking American teenagers (ages 13-19). These users are typically digitally native, comfortable with interactive web or mobile applications, and are likely seeking engaging, casual entertainment or creative outlets. They are often interested in novel and shareable experiences, and while they are fluent in English, the project's subtle grammatical guidance (specifically around verb tenses) could offer a fun, low-pressure way to reinforce language understanding without feeling overtly educational. They might enjoy the humor generated by unexpected word combinations and the collaborative aspect of building a story.
